## üîå Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Releases with Advanced Queries
```typescript
import { cosmic } from '@/lib/cosmic'

// Get all releases with categories and components
const releases = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'releases' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata', 'created_at'])
  .depth(1)

// Get featured releases only
const featuredReleases = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ 
    type: 'releases',
    'metadata.featured': true 
  })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)

// Search releases by version or content
const searchResults = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ 
    type: 'releases',
    $or: [
      { 'title': { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
      { 'metadata.version': { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } },
      { 'metadata.summary': { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } }
    ]
  })
  .depth(1)
```

### Type-Safe Data Handling
```typescript
import { Release, Category, Component } from '@/types'

// Properly typed release handling
const processRelease = (release: Release): string => {
  const version = release.metadata?.version || release.title
  const releaseDate = new Date(
    release.metadata?.release_date || release.created_at
  ).toLocaleDateString()
  
  return `${version} - ${releaseDate}`
}

// Safe category access with type checking
const getCategoryColor = (category: Category): string => {
  return category.metadata?.color || '#6B7280'
}
```
